# Commits

## Add ##
`git add` is used to add files to a staging area so the collection of staged files can be committed.

## Commit ##
`git commit` commits files to the local repository. Files must be staged first with `git add`. A commit message can be added with the -m argument.

Example:
`git commit -m "Adds Commits read me."
